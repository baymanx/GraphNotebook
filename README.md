## Overview
While taking notes, I realized that much of the information I deal with is not best represented as a linear mind map, but rather as an interconnected knowledge graph.  
To explore this idea, I started building this project.

## Status
This is currently in a very early, conceptual **experimental stage**.  
Many features are placeholders, but the current setup works well enough for my personal use.

## Future Plans
I am considering a complete rewrite in the future using a more robust and performance-friendly approach that organizes nodes more logically by adding structures like trees, timelines, and subnodes, and adding AI-powered integration to transform any files into unified graph-based notes.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Flask

### Installation & Run
```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/baymanx/GraphNotebook.git
cd GraphNotebook

# Install dependencies
pip install flask

# Run the application
python graph_note.py
```

## Usage
- Double-click blank space to create a new node  
- Double-click a node to rename it
- Left-click a node to select and drag it
- Right-click two nodes to connect them  
- Right-click a connection to delete it
